## Tutorial 1 : MNIST

1. Training Phase : See this [link(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cDfsA_no_bLmv5S7217nL0UcEd2nZ1Hr?usp=sharing)

	We trained 50,000 numbers with Open Dataset, MNIST.

	You may remember the only ```mnist_99acc_model.h5``` file.

	It helps to load model paramters easily.

	In this course, you can train in colab with GPU for free. It is too hard to train mnist datasets with Jetson Nano toolkits, because of low memories. **I strongly recommend to train with devices having GPUs.**

2. Data Preparation : See this [link(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18eUHkOg5jy2YgugphupEjhuAMmem56uD?usp=sharing)

3. Inference : Same as the number 2.
