## Introduction : Teachble Machine

![introduction1](../Teachable_Machine/Introduce1.png)

This is made by [Google CreativeLab](https://github.com/googlecreativelab) Team. [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. It trains a model to recognize your own 

- images
- sounds
- poses. 

![Introduction2](../Teachable_Machine/Introduce2.png)

We can train models by just clicking the mouse button. **Therefore, expertise and coding skill are not required.** For instance, I'll show you two characters(figures) from "ONE PIECE"

- Mihawk
- Shanks

The figrues' information is given below. Let's try to **classify images.**

## 1. How to train

It's so easy. Juet follow them. Whatever you picked any projects, it is not a problem. But, to follow this project, I recommend **"to choose Image Projects"**. You can see the above picture.

1. Push "Webcam" Button. (You may modify the class name.)

	![push_them](../Teachable_Machine/push_webcam.png)

2. Just Keep pushing "Hold a Record Button". Then, You can collect your datasets fast.

	![Keep_Push2](../Teachable_Machine/Mihawk_Labeling.gif)

3. If you've fininshed to set Image Datasets, then push the "Train Model" Button.

That's all.

## 2. Inference and Results

You can view your trained results. Moreover you can download your datasets and model.

![Output](../Teachable_Machine/output.gif)

The picture given below is when you clicked the button "Export model". From "Tensorflow.js" banner, you can refer to url containing model and datasets. Only in "Tensorflow" banner, you can test simply python codes. You need a tensorflow modules. "Tensorflow Lite" supports to mobile or other edge devices.

![Output](../Teachable_Machine/Download_Mymodel.png)

I also made ```{DL_course/Image_Classficiation/Cam_Classify.py}``` for you. So you can also simulate this file. **If you want to experiment your own datasets, then overwrite ```labels.txt``` and ```keras_model.h5``` from ```converted_keras.zip``` file.**

```shell
$ python3 Cam_Classify.py
```

You can escape by pushing ```q``` key!!. The FPS of this program will be much low, beacuse Teachable Machine supports GPU remotely. Despite of this, it may operate well.

Anyway, you can see more details, such as model parameters, model loss, accuracy and so on in "Teachable Machine" site...

## Introduction : MNIST

[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png">](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MnistExamples.png)

MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is the database of handwritten digits, ([visit for this page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)), which obtains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. It is basically used for Deep Learning. We aim to classify the numbers from 0 to 9. Furthermore, we test for our handmade digits, with our made Deep Learning models.

To proceed this course, simply check this :

*You need to set directories on ```{your_directory}/AI_beginner_course/DL_course/Image_Classification```*

So, don't forget below line :
```shell
$ cd AI_beginner_course/DL_course/Image_Classification/
```

## 1. Training Phase 
	
See this [link(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cDfsA_no_bLmv5S7217nL0UcEd2nZ1Hr?usp=sharing)

We trained 60,000 numbers of images(Open Dataset, MNIST).

You may remember the only ```mnist_99acc_model.h5``` file. (You can [Download here](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tTfB7C4Imavg_ppIwXk0DG-cRkA5P_mt))

It helps to load model paramters easily. 

(In this course, you can train in colab with GPU for free. It is too hard to train mnist datasets with Jetson Nano toolkits, because of low memories. **I strongly recommend to train with devices having GPUs.**)

## 2. Data Preparation
	
See this [link(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18eUHkOg5jy2YgugphupEjhuAMmem56uD?usp=sharing)
	
This helps your handmade datasets to become suitable inputs of this model.

I wrote this codes about Data Preprocessing.

- How to run? (Your directories must be on ```Image_Classification/```)

	1. Prepare only a written number (0 ~ 9)	

		There are some rules. Keep in mind!

		```
		1. The written number should be enough large (Recommend to take over the 60% area)
		2. The written number should be the only one number
		  (e.g. never recognize 32, 64, 58... Only allow "0", "3". etc.)
		3. The more Pen thickness, the better.
		4. The background (paper) should be white. Don't shade the light by cameras.
		```

		For example, there is a good case
		
		<img src="../MNIST/3.jpg" width="100px" height="50px"> <img src="../MNIST/7.jpg" width="100px" height ="50px"> <img src="../MNIST/8.jpg" width="100px" height ="50px"> <img src="../MNIST/9.jpg" width="100px" height ="50px">
			
		Then, these result will be

		![index](../MNIST/index.png)

	2. Now, let's Run "Data_Preparation.py"
		
		Note that we don't care what the file names are. You only need any ".jpg" files
			
		At, ```{your_directory}AI_beginner_course/DL_course/Image_Classification}```,
		```shell
		$ tree .
		.
		├── Data_Preparation.py
		├── Test_0.jpg
		├── Test_1.jpg
		├── Test_2.jpg
		└── Test_3.jpg

		0 directories, 5 files
		```
			
		Then ```*.jpg``` files will convert to ```Preprocessed_i.jpg``` files by running this py :
			

		```shell
		$ python3 Data_Preparation.py
		```

		Results:
		```shell
		$ tree .
		.
		├── Data_Preparation.py
		├── PreProcessed
		│   ├── Preprocessed_0.jpg
		│   ├── Preprocessed_1.jpg
		│   ├── Preprocessed_2.jpg
		│   └── Preprocessed_3.jpg
		├── Test_0.jpg
		├── Test_1.jpg
		├── Test_2.jpg
		└── Test_3.jpg

		1 directory, 9 files
		```


## 3. Inference 

See this [link(colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18eUHkOg5jy2YgugphupEjhuAMmem56uD?usp=sharing) (Same as 2)

You can test on your written numbers at ```AI_beginner_course/Image_Classification/Inference.py```.
Your written and resized ```PreProcessed/Preprocessed_i.jpg``` files will be evaluated from saved ```Image_Classification/mnist_99acc_model.h5``` Anyway, 

```shell
$ python3 Inference.py

(omit)

In PreProcessed folder, there are files :
 ['PreProcessed/Preprocessed_0.jpg', 'PreProcessed/Preprocessed_1.jpg', 'PreProcessed/Preprocessed_2.jpg', 'PreProcessed/Preprocessed_3.jpg'] 
	
(omit)

From PreProcessed/Preprocessed_0.jpg, We predicted :  [3] .

From PreProcessed/Preprocessed_1.jpg, We predicted :  [7] .

From PreProcessed/Preprocessed_2.jpg, We predicted :  [8] .

From PreProcessed/Preprocessed_3.jpg, We predicted :  [4] .
```
	
## FAQ

Q. I got a problem with :
```shell
ImportError: /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block
```
Then, what should I do?

A. Add at shell
```shell
$ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1
```

From now on, you've checked a simple model training and inference with MNIST!
